PROBLEM:

MMV (Mathematical Modeling Virus) is a viral infection that can cause a serious disease (called MMD)

MMD patients are unable to control their natural urge to make mathematical models that attempt to describe biological phenomena\

The rapid MMV test gives a positive result:

100% of the time for people with the virus

5% of the time for people without the virus

A certain population has a prevalence of 1%

You pick a person from this population at random, and test them, and the test is positive.

What is the probability that they have MMV?
You learn that your friend has a positive rapid test for MMV. What do you tell them?


SOLUTION:

Assign probabilities to each of these:

You pick a person from this population at random, and test them, and the test is positive.

The rapid MMV test gives a positive result:

A certain population has a prevalence of 1%	1/100

100% of the time for people with the virus		100/100

5% of the time for people without the virus		5/100

You pick a person from this population at random, and test them, and the test is positive.

What is the probability that they have MMV?

1/100 * 100/100 * 5/100 = 0.0005

\f1 You learn that your friend has a positive rapid test for MMV. What do you tell them?\
- Hmmmmmm\
So chances that they actually have MMV is 1 in 50,000 people

There fore the probability that they have MMV is 0.05%
