## Formulate two different hypotheses about your data, and describe how you would 
## test them with two different permutation tests (In README file)
## Implement one or both of these tests in R. 
## You can use permutation, or you can use a classic test if you explain clearly 
## how it corresponds to a permutation test. Best would be to use both.
