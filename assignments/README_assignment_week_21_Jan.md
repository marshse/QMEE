## JD: Not sure whether you meant to explain something to us here

## SMR: Apologies!  This assignment was not ready to go yet and I was in the midst of restructuring the folders.

### Construct some (i.e., more than one) ggplots using your data. 

Discuss:
- what you are trying to show

    - Visualized body size data on fish (*S. ocellatus*), by Type, caught in 2016 using geom_jitter() versus geom_point()
    
    - Played with adding geom commands together and changing visual parameters (colour, position, size)
    
    - Plot body measurements taken over the field season by Type (my date column needs to be reformatted to do this)

- some of the choices I have made

- the basis for my choices (e.g., Cleveland hierarchy, proximity of comparisons, or other principles of graphical communication)

    -
