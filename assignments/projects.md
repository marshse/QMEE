## Final Project Suggestion

Title: 10 words

ideas about what data and questions you would pursue. <200 words

DATA AVAILABLE:

Annual (2014-2018) Demographic fish dataset taken during the spawning season of Symphodus ocellatus:
(dataset contains info on: sex by type [female, nesting male, satellite male, sneaker male] standard length SL, weight, Nest # [if known], date caught)
Other Known Info: Females can be 1, 2 or 3 years old. NM are 2 (and occasionally 3) years old, Sat Males are 1 or 2 years old, Sn Males are 1 (and occasionally 2) year old

Annual (2014-2018) Daily Nest Surveys in the study site:
Daily census data that tracks individual nests at the main study site (which is kept the same every year (same site each year).
- once a nest in identified and given a number in the study site, we follow it through the nesting cycle
- that nest is visited everyday and we record:
  - presence of Nesting Male (NM)
  - where NM is in the breeding cycle (Building, Spawning, Fanning) sometimes these lines blur when entered into our data sheet  ex. B/S, S/F instead of just B, S, F
  - presence of Satellite Male, presence and number of Sneaker Males, presence and number of females.
  
  
QUESTIONS:

1. How do mean body condition scores (Wt/(10*SL)^3) vary between the Types [female, nesting male, satellite male, sneaker male] collapsing across years?

2. How do body condition scores change for each Type over the course of the breeding season?

3. Can we figure out a method that enables us to compare the body condition scores by Type collected over multiple years? (ie, that somehow controls for where there are in that particular breeding season)
  ex. Can we compare at similar dates each year?
      Should we correlate with other measurments in this system to compare acorss years? 
      i.e., correlate with water temperatures instead of date?
