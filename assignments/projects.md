## Final Project Suggestion

TITLE: 10 words


DATA AVAILABLE:

1) Annual (2014-2018) Demographic fish dataset taken during the spawning season of Symphodus ocellatus:
- dataset contains info on: 
    - sex by type [female, nesting male, satellite male, sneaker male] 
    - standard length SL, 
    - weight, 
    - Nest # [if known], 
    - date caught
- Other Known Info: 
  - Females can be 1, 2 or 3 years old. 
  - NM are 2 (and occasionally 3) years old, 
  - Sat Males are 1 or 2 years old, 
  - Sn Males are 1 (and occasionally 2) year old

2) Annual (2014-2018) Daily Nest Surveys in the study site:
Daily census data that tracks individual nests at the main study site (which is kept the same every year (same site each year).
- once a nest in identified and given a number in the study site, we follow it through the nesting cycle
- that nest is visited everyday and we record:
  - presence of Nesting Male (NM)
  - where NM is in the breeding cycle (Building, Spawning, Fanning) sometimes these lines blur when entered into our data sheet  ex. B/S, S/F instead of just B, S, F
  - presence of Satellite Male, presence and number of Sneaker Males, presence and number of females.
  
  
QUESTIONS:

1. How does mean body condition scores (Wt/(10*SL)^3) vary between the Types [female, nesting male, satellite male, sneaker male] collapsing across years? 

2. How does body condition scores change for each Type over the course of the breeding season, collapsing across years?

3. Can we figure out a method that enables us to compare the body condition scores by Type collected over multiple years? (i.e., that somehow controls for where they are in a particular point in the  breeding season)
  ex. Can we compare at similar dates each year?
      Do spawning cyles follow similar patterns each year?
      Are spawning cycles each year affected by factors such as water temparature? other factors to consider?

4. We have morphometric data that identifies both Nesting Males and Satellite males caught from the same nest across seasons.
  - Do 'bigger" (or better body condition) Satellites associate with bigger (or better body condition) Nesting Males?
    Does this change throughout the breeding season?
