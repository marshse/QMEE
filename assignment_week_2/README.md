1) Describe what sorts of investigations you might do with the data:

  - Once I have figured out how to plot the data properly (!) I'd like to calculate the body condition for the various Types
    - What is the amount of variation in body condition for each Type and how much does it differ between types?
    - Does body condition of each Type change (decrease) over the course of the spawning season? (ie. do fish caught at later dates have a lower body condition score)
    - Is there any relationship between size or body condition of NM(Nesting Males) and Sat Males? (ie. Do larger Sat's associate at a nest with a larger NM? Do smaller NM's have smaller Sat's?)
    - We know that Sat Males can be either one or two years old.
      - Examine distribution in SL and Body Condition to see if there is a bi-modal distribution
    - We also know that Females can be one, two, or three years old.
      - Examine the distribution in SL and Body Condition and to see if there may be "size classes" in this Type 
      

2) Describe how to break the project into replicable components:

  - Import the data
  - Examine the structure and look for mistakes on class assignment
  - Select data that I wish to examine (in this case: Type, SL, Wt)
  - Re-examine summary after selecting columns
  - Exclude some elements in Types(-rostratus, -Sat/sn)
  - Change names of vectors (f to Fem, sn to SnM, Sat to SatM in Types)
  - Plot the Wt (weight) of fish by type (Fem, NM, SatM,SnM)
  - Plot the SL (standard length) of fish by type (Fem, NM, SatM,SnM)
