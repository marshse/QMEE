## My Datasets 

I have selected two datasets that will need to be combined (and refined at some point) and were collected during a field season in May-June 2016 at STARESO Research Station (Corsica, France).

We study a small fish species, <i>Symphodus ocellatus</i>, during their spawning season in the Mediterranean Sea each spring.  There are three male types in the system (type is not genetic, but a life history trait and based on amount of growth in first year). Nesting males are the largest most colourful males who make a nest, court females, and fan eggs. Sneaker males are the smallest, resemble females and hang around active nests attempting to sneak fertilizations.  Satellite males are an intermediate size and will associate with a Nesting Male and help by bringing in nearby females, chase off sneaker males, but will also attempt to sneak fertilizations when possible.  Females spawn in multiple nests and provide no care.


## Corse 2016 Genetics book.xlsx
- This spreadsheet contains information about all fish that were caught and brought into the lab for processing before being released back into the study site.  
- It gives information on:	
	fish ID 
        standard length [SL]
        weight [WT]
        individual mark given [Mark]
        type or sex [ NM = Nesting Male; SAT = Satellite Male; SN = Sneaker Male; F = Female]
        nest # where they were captured (Focal nests are identified with a numbered cork so that we can map the location and revisit the nest on a daily basis.)
        study used for [sat var = satellite variation; sn removal = sneaker removal]
        

## Satellite variation spreadsheet_2016_07_06.xlsx

- This spreadsheet contains behavioural observations conducted for a 10 miunte period on focal nests.  
- Data collected:
        number of sneakers near the nest every minute
        location of the Nesting Male every 30 seconds
        proximity of Satellite male near the nest every minute
        counts for female visits, spawning events and sneaking events
        social behaviours (aggression and submission between the male types)
        other behaviours (nest defence, nest building, nest tending, courtship)
        
- At some nests we simply observe interactions between males and details around spawning events (Sat Variation, Sat Variation Followup).  Some nests experienced a manipulation (removal of sneaker males in the area), and we conducted both pre and post observations (SN Decrease Pre, SN Decrease Post). 


## Biological Questions

 - Satellite Variation
        - Examine size relationship in NestingMale/Satellite male pairs.
        - Examine size relationship and relation to other behaviours (eg. aggression rates, submission rates, defense rates, courting rates, sneaking rates)
        

  - Sneaker Removal
        - Do spawning rates changes after the removal of sneaker males?
        - Do Nesting Males change certain behaviours after removal of sneaker males?
        - Do Satellite Males change certain behaviours after removal of sneaker males?
        - Do female visits and spawning rates change ater removal of sneaker males?
        
        Not an exhaustive list and will progress thought the term! :-)
